Color Preferences, Print Settings, and Quantities


*** Quantities ***
All files have a "x#" at the end of the name to denote the number of prints of the particular file. For the main repository, all single files should only be printed once!


*** Color Preferences ***
(a) - Files that start with this should be printed in Polymaker Teal (ABS).
(m) - Files that start with this should be printed in a black (ABS).
(white) - These files should be printed in a thin white (ABS) as they will be a light diffuser for an LED on the face of the toolhead shroud. 


*** Print Settings *** 
If there are specific print settings for a set of files, they will be included in a text file within that folder. 

If no print settings are listed, please use the standard Zero G settings:
