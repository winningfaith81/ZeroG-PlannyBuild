# ZeroG-PlannyBuild
My ZeroG Build for my 1st printer, Planny. She's a Creality Ender 5 Pro. 

**This code is not my work!**
This collection is my effort at gathering all of the published files out there to be able to create the Zero G Electronics Enclosure for a non-Hydra Ender 5 Pro. These files were either taken directly from [their project website](https://docs.zerog.one/) or from their [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/zerog). 
I claim no ownership for this body of work, other than I gathered it. Go me. Me gather. 

_A big thank you to all of the engineers and users on Discord that have modified and shared files and documents for the rest of us to enjoy the Zero G goodness!_
